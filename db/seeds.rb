resource11 = Resource.create(title: 'FLUX Contemporary Movement Practice with Lauren Beale', description: 'FLUX Contemporary Movement Practice for Intermediate and Advanced movers, flows from a deep 6 layer system of embodied intelligence. From stillness we begin each class with cultivating dynamic awareness in the here and now. Surrendering to a felt sense in the body comes the practice of being present to what is alive in the moment and moving beyond patterns of assumption, expectation, judgement or criticism. From an expanded range of awareness, root strength will be activated by channeling and siphoning your unique life force through the body from the ground up. The exploration of anchored resistance will build the foundation to play within the forces of gravity, inertia, momentum and energy, in and out of the floor and through space. Each point of contact with the floor becomes a launch pad for moving power, information, conversation and expression fluidly through the body and through the world. Through improvisation, structured movement and partner work, this class will challenge and expand the diversity of your kinesthetic expression multi-dimensionally within your self, from self to each other, from relationship to community. You will leave with greater freedom to inhabit your fullest self with agency, authenticity and interconnection.Lauren Beale is a performing artist, choreographer, improviser, contemplative teacher and yoga instructor.
