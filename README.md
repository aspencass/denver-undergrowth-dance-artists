# UNDERGROWTH Denver

This app creates a place for Denver dance artists to connect via classes, festivals, professional development, resource sharing, and ongoing meetings. 

I created this App because it waters a particular malnourishment of the Denver Dance Community. By pooling in dance resources across the Denver-Metro area, artists can depend on a more robust and central source of community information and offerings. 

More Specifically, this is a ✨REVAMP✨ of --> https://undergrowthdenver.com/ that adds a listings page for resources that can be filtered & added to, as well as a Login, and Community Calendar. 


## User Stories / As a user I can...

View, Filer by type, and Add Dance Resources to both a Listings page and Community Calendar. I can read about past meetings and the mission of UNDERGROWTH. I can Log in / Log out.
